# geocoding-example
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mapbox/geocoding-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mapbox/geocoding-example)

Examples of how to use the Mapbox geocoder. We do our best to make our [geocoding API simple to understand](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/#geocoding). But sometimes it's nice to see example implementations of things like batch geocoding where parallelization and throttling are necessary.

This repo is a work in progress. Don't see your favorite language? [Open a ticket](https://github.com/mapbox/geocoding-example/issues/new)!

Please consult individual subdirectories' README files for more specific installation instructions and notes.  PHP Examples are available in the [Mapbox PHP SDK Repo](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-php).

## Note

Permanent and batch geocoding is currently only available for enterprise plans. Please email sales@mapbox.com if you're interested in testing this functionality.
